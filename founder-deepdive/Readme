First try on extractors:

- done on the same data than for the tutorial (can easily be extanded to the all wikipedia corpus)
- this folder should be put in the folder deepdive/app (same place as the folder "spouse" of the tutorial)
- run setup_database.sh to create the db
- run run.sh to create the extractors and extract the people and companies from the text

The file run contains all the "export" commands so should work without running them again before.

This Sunday, I will finish the extractors part to extract the couples (people, companies), create the training set and define 
the features to be learnt by deepdive.
